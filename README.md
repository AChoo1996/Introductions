# Introductions

Hello Viewers!

  I'm Allen Chau, currently a Senior attending Sacramento State University as a Computer Engineer major.
  My inspiration comes from my role in the household where I was the "tech-savy" person to go to for technical problems.
                    - Currently looking for a job relating to Firmware :) -
  I'm familiar with Java, C, and a bit of Python.
  My partners and I built our first RC Bluetooth Surveillance Bot.
  I enjoy working hands on and like to build computers along with fixing broken things.
  I also enjoy the feeling of actually putting something together and having it work!
  I'm eager to explore my major and see what it has to offer.
  I'm very friendly and down to earth.
  Besides that, I like playing video games like Player Unknown Battlegrounds and Rocket League!
